A seguito di ciò è stato effettuato un riconteggio dei casi da cui sono emersi 55 casi guariti e 3 decessi non ancora comunicati. Al fine di sanare questa situazione nei dati odierni è quindi necessario incrementare il numero dei guariti e dei decessi rispettivamente di 55 e 3 unità portando così il numero totale dei casi a 9236. Questo implica che la differenza con i casi comunicati ieri segna un incremento di 134 unità. Considerato però che 58 casi sono riferiti all’anno precedente i casi reali rilevati nelle ultime 24 ore sono 76 e non è presente nessun decesso nelle 24 ore.",0,,,9048,188,80933,13311,ITC,ITC2,9102,134,7839,71,38,7,421,3,9,-1,92907,1337,50480,560
